# bank-decision-tree

This project uses a Decision Tree Machine Learning model to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their personal and campaign data.

1. Files in the Project
File	Description
bank.csv	Dataset containing bank customer and marketing information
DecisionTreeBank.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook with Python code for training and testing Decision Tree model
2. What the Notebook Does

The notebook performs these steps:

Imports the dataset

Cleans and prepares data for machine learning

Splits the data into training and testing sets

Trains a Decision Tree Classifier

Tests the model and prints accuracy

Shows the confusion matrix

Visualizes the Decision Tree graph

3. Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

4. How to Run the Project

Install required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Run the notebook:

DecisionTreeBank.ipynb

5. Output of the Project

After running the code, you will get:

Accuracy of the model

Confusion matrix plot

Decision Tree visualization

Prediction whether the customer subscribes to a deposit (yes/no)

6. Goal of the Project

To use machine learning (Decision Tree) to help banks understand and target customers who are likely to subscribe to term deposits.
